# FlappyBird_Python
Project files for a reinforcement learning approach to train an agent to play Flappy Bird effectively.

Run flappy_update.py to play normally.

Run flappy_logger.py to play normally, and record your actions locally for future reference (still in progress).

Run flappy_qlearning.py to have the RL agent play. Currently, the agent will train without a starting reference each time the game is run. Still in progress.
